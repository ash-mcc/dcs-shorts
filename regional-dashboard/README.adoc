= "_How is waste_ in my area?" - a regional dashboard

== Introduction

Our aim in this piece of work is:
[quote]
to surface facts of interest (max/mins, trends, etc.)
about waste in an area, to non-experts.

Towards that aim, we have built a prototype *_regional dashboard_*
which is directly powered by our
https://github.com/data-commons-scotland/dcs-easier-open-data['easier datasets']
about waste.

The prototype is a webapp and it can be accessed https://data-commons-scotland.github.io/prototype-6/#/regional-dashboard[*here*].

== Curiosities

Even this early prototype manages to surface some curiosities footnote:[One of the original sources of data has been off-line due to a cyberattack so, at the time of writing, it has not been possible to double-check all figures from our prototype against original sources.]
...

==== Inverclyde

Inverclyde is doing well.

image:inverclyde-hw-gen.png["Inverclyde's household waste generation", width="260px"]
image:inverclyde-hw-co2e.png["Inverclyde's household waste CO2e", width="200px"]

In the latest data (2019), it generates the [green]#fewest# tonnes of household waste (per citizen) of any of the council areas.
And its same [green]#1^st^# position for CO~2~e indicates the close relation between the amount of waste generated and its carbon impact.

[teal]#_...But why is Inverclyde doing so well?_#

==== Highland

Highland isn't doing so well.

image:highland-hw-gen.png["Highland's household waste generation", width="256px"]
image:highland-hw-re.png["Highland's household waste % recycled", width="200px"]

In the latest data (2019), it generates the [red]#most# (except for Argyll & Bute) tonnes of household waste (per citizen) of any of the council areas.
And it has the [red]#worst# trend for percentage recycled.

[teal]#_...Why is Highland's percentage recycled been getting worse since 2014?_#

==== Fife

Fife has the [green]#best# trend for household waste generation.
That said, it still has been generating an above the average amount of waste per citizen.

image:fife-hw-gen.png["Fife's household waste generation", width="242px"]

The graphs for Fife business waste show that there was an acute [green]#reduction#
in combustion wastes in 2016.

We investigated this _anomaly_
https://github.com/data-commons-scotland/dcs-shorts/tree/master/longannet-found-in-the-data[before]
and discovered that it was caused by the closure of Fife's coal fired
power station (Longannet) on 24th March 2016.

==== Angus

In the latest two years of data (2018 & 2019), Angus has noticibly [green]#reduced# the amount of household waste that it landfills.

image:angus-hw-mgnt.png["Angus' household waste management", width="256px"]

During the same period, Angus has increased the amount household waste that it processes as 'other diversion'.

[teal]#_...What underlies that difference in Angus' waste processing?_#

== Technologies

This prototype is built as a 'static' website
with all content-dynamics occurring in the browser.
This makes it simple and cheap to host,
but results in _heavier_, more complex web pages.

* The clickable map is implemented on Leaflet - with Open Street Map map tiles.
* The charts are constructed using Vega-lite.
* The content-dynamics are coded in ClojureScript - with Hiccup for HTML, and Reagent for events.
* The website is hosted on GitHub.

== Ideas for evolving this prototype

[lowerroman]
. Provide more _qualitative_ information.
This version is quite _quantitative_ because, well, that is nature of the
datasets that currently underlay it.
So there's a danger of straying into the "_managment by KPI_" approach
when we should be supporting the "_management by understanding_" approach.
. Include more localised information, e.g. about an area's re-use shops, or bin collection statistics.
. Support _deeper dives_, e.g. so that users can click on a CO~2~e trend to navigate to a choropleth map for CO~2~e.
. Allow users to download any of the displayed charts as (CSV) data or as (PNG) images.
. Enhance the support of comparisons by allowing users to _multi-select_ regions and overlay their charts.
. Allow users to choose from a menu, what chart/data tiles to place on the page.
. Provide a _what-if?_ tool.
"What if every region reduced by 10% their landfilling of waste material xyz?" - where the tool
has a good enough _waste model_ to enable it to compute _what-if?_ outcomes.
