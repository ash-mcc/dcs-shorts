= Waste quantities through time, on a map

WARNING: A work-in-progress.

== Preface

Shortly before the end of 2020, I attended the
https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/code-the-city-21-put-your-city-on-the-map/[Code The City 21: Put Your City on the Map]
_hack weekend_ which explored ideas for putting open data onto geographic maps.

It ran several interesting projects.
There was one was especially inspiring to me: the Bioregion Dashboard.
Its idea is to tell an evidence-backed _story-through-the-years_,
involving interactive data displays against a map.
James Littlejohn introduces it in https://youtu.be/C0OSjIu3ZT4[this YouTube video].

This got me thinking about new ways to depict the information that is bound up
in the data about waste...

In particular, about a means to convey _at-a-glance_, to the lay person, how councils areas
compare through time in respect of the amounts of (household solid) waste that they
process. Now, the
https://github.com/data-commons-scotland/dcs-shorts/blob/master/pivot-drilldown-and-plot/README.adoc[grid & graph prototype]
that we built a couple of months back,
conveys that same information very well (and with a greater fidelity than we
will mange in this work) but, it isn't attention grabbing for the lay person - like me.
I like seeing something with movement and with features that I can relate to,
such as animated charts and a geographical map.

== The prototype webapp

Leveraging what I learnt at the Code the City 21 _hack weekend_,
I hacked together a prototype webapp
that shows how waste quantity change through time, on a geographic map.

The below, animated image of the webapp, shows it conveying that
landfilled-waste has reduced over time while total-waste has remained _fairly_ constant.

=== UI controls

* Choose the _dataset of interest_ using the image:dropdown.png[dropdown] control, either:
[lowerroman]
. Tonnes of managed solid household waste per person per year.
. Tonnes of C0~2~ equivalent from household waste per person per year.
* Use the image:slider.png["slider"] control to _travel through time_.
* Each image:pie.png["pie"] chart depicts the waste-related quantities for a council area.
** The sizes of its slices and its overall size, are related to the quantities that it depicts.
* Hover over a council area to see detailed metrics in the image:detail.png["detail", width=130] panel.
* The usual map zoom and pan controls are supported.

=== Software and datasets

* The open source https://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet] and https://antares.rte-france.com/[Minichart]
libraries take care of most of the _heavy lifting_ (interactive graphics).
* The map's base layer comes from https://esri.maps.arcgis.com/home/[Esri ArcGIS].
(The images in this document, contain a https://stadiamaps.com/[Stadia Maps] base layer
but this can't be used at runtime without an account.)
* The map's council area boundary data originates from the http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/[ONS],
and has been curated by https://github.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON[Martin Chorely].
* The datasets for the pie charts, are:
[lowerroman]
. http://statistics.gov.scot/data/population-estimates-current-geographic-boundaries["Population Estimates (Current Geographic Boundaries)"]
curated in the Scottish government's linked-data store,
and authored by https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/[NRS] in 2020.
. http://statistics.gov.scot/data/household-waste["Generation and Management of Household Waste"]
curated in the Scottish government's linked-data store,
and authored by https://www.sepa.org.uk/[SEPA] in 2020.
. https://www.sepa.org.uk/media/532206/2019-household-waste-data-tables.xlsx["Carbon footprint"]

== Closing thoughts

I haven't seen these datasets about waste shown in this way before,
and I think that it usefully conveys aspects of the datasets
in a _catchy_ and easy to understand way.
It is low fidelity when compared to a full data grid with graph solution,
but the idea is to hold the attention of the average person in the street.

Future work could integrate additional waste-relevant datasets that have geography and time dimensions.
Also we should consider alternative metrics (such as ratios),
alternative charts (such as bar or polar) and alternative statistics (such as deviation or trend).
I went with the 'most straightforward' but user-testing might indicate that an alternative is better.
