= Waste quantities through time, on a map

== Introduction

Shortly before the end of 2020, I attended the CTC21 event whose breakout groups
explored ideas around putting open data onto geographic maps (see James' stuff). 
This got me thinking about new ways to depict the information that is bound up
in the data about waste.

In particular, a means to convey at-a-glance, to the lay person, how councils areas
compare through time in respect of the amounts of (household solid) waste that they
process. Now, the grid & graph prototype that we built a couple of months back,
depicts conveys that same information very well (and with a greater fidelity than we
will mange in this work) but, it isn't attention grabbing for the lay person - like me!
I like seeing something with movement and with features that I can relate to.
...ie animated charts and a geo map

== Closing thoughts

* Considered alternative metrics (such as ratios), alternative charts (such as bar and polar) 
and alernative statistics (such as deviation and trend)
but went with the 'most straightforward' (user testing might indicate that an alternatives is 'better').
* Generalise to other geo-mappable Scottish data.
