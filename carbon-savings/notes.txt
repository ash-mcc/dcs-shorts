Asciidoc -> HTML
	asciidoctor -b html5 README.adoc -o index.html
	...out-of-the-box, asciidoctor generates nicer HTML5 than asciidoc 

HTML -> PDF
	open in a web browser, the HTML file that was generated by the previous step 
          and then ask the web browser to export the HTML page as PDF 

Asciidoc -(straight to)-> PDF
	asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-pdf -b pdf -a allow-uri-read README.adoc -o building-lod-about-carbon-savings.pdf

	...TODO: make it a proper standalone PDF by:
							- moving all ref'd CSV etc. files into appendixes
							- changing all hyperlinked ref-ings to ref biblio entries
