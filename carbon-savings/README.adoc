This is a _walk-through_ of how we can build *linked open data* (LoD) about *carbon savings* from dissimilar data sources.

== Reference data

The _carbon impact_ is a measure devised by 
https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/[Zero Waste Scotland] (ZWS), 
to convey the whole-life carbon impact of waste, from resource extraction and manufacturing emissions, right through to waste management emissions. 
Its unit-of-measure is _tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent_ (CO~2~eT).

This is a reasonable basis for measuring carbon savings so we will use it as _reference data_.
 
It is defined in
https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/sites/default/files/The%20Scottish%20Carbon%20Metric.pdf[The Scottish Carbon Metric] document. 
For our purpose, its key data is in table 6.2.
This contains per-material weight-multipliers that can be used to calaculate CO~2~eT amounts. 

Here's a snipped image of that table:

image::carbon-metric-table-6_2-snippet.png["The key data in The Scottish Carbon Metric", width=50%]

NOTE: This table's data has been published as linked open data by our project, in previous work.
See the `co2e-multiplier` files in https://github.com/data-commons-scotland/dcs-easier-open-data[this repo]. But we will redo that work here so that that we can provide an explanatory walk-through.

We copy the table's data from its original PDF format into a more tractable, 
CSV file: link:carbon-metric.csv[carbon-metric.csv].
Here's a snippet of data from that file:

[format="csv",options="header",width=50%]
|===================================================
include::carbon-metric.csv[lines=1..8]
|===================================================

So, for our carbon savings data:

* CO~2~eT will be used as the primary unit-of-measure
* link:carbon-metric.csv[carbon-metric.csv] will be referenced as the basis for calculations.
+
For example, consider 1 tonne of (used) shoes.
If these were landfilled at a waste site then the _carbon impact_ would be: 1 x 31.17 CO2~e~T.
Instead, if a reuse store sells them to its customers, it has made a _carbon saving_ of 31.17 CO2~e~T.

CAUTION: The term _carbon saving_ is a little misleading. A better name for it might be _carbon impact deferrals_ since all objects are eventually disposed of. But we won't pursue that philosphical totality in this document.

== Measurement data

We take examples of meaurement data from 4 sources.

Their data is dissimilar, for example:

* emailed Excel files vs. CKAN hosted CSV files
* kilograms vs. tonnes
* various means of indicating a date
* various ways of categorising the stuff that gets reused. 

However, our end goal is to derive the same information from each of them, for example:

|===================================================


=== Alloa Community Enterprises - reused furniture

https://ace.scot/[Alloa Community Enterprises]' (ACE) 
furniture reuse initiative has been running since 1984, helping prevent furniture from becoming waste.

ACE is in the process of publishing its data as open data. 
The following examples of measurement data have been taken from a draft of that work.


=== Stirling Community Food - redistributed food

https://www.transitionstirling.org.uk/community-food[Stirling Community Food]
 is a project that helps to reduce food waste in Stirling by collecting (from supermarkets & aggregators) excess and near-sell-by-date food, routing it away from waste bins, and making it available (for free) to the community.

Stirling Community Food is in the process of publishing its data as open data. 
The following examples of measurement data have been taken from a draft of that work.

=== Stirling Council - household recycling bins

https://stirling.gov.uk/council-democracy/access-to-information/open-data/[Stirling Council] set a precedent by being the first (and still only) Scottish local authority to have published open data about their bin collection of household waste. 

The following examples of measurement data have been taken from that published data.

=== The Fair Share - reused student-oriented items

https://www.stirlingstudentsunion.com/sustainability/fairshare/[The Fair Share] is a university based, reuse store. It accepts donations of second-hand books, clothes, kitchenware, electricals, etc. and sells these to students.

The Fair Share is in the process of publishing its data as open data. 
The following examples of measurement data have been taken from a draft of that work.


== Converting it to linked data

== Publishing it as open data

== Using it

== Next?

* Add other dimensions such as geographic region (sourced from? given to?)
* Adopt other vocabs? (statistical vocabs?)
* Support upload by enablers (upload -> validate -> add to the published LoD)
* Context: COP26 etc.
